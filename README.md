R package to analysis electrophysiological data. The focus is on data from tetrode recording experiments.

If you want to modify the code of relecto, I recommand using R studio together with the book "R Packages" by Hadley Wickham. Most of the tools used to develop relectro are presented in this book.

If you just want to use the functions and objects of relectro, go in the terminal and 
run the following

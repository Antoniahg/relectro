This is a R package to analysis electrophysiological data with R.

If you are starting you might want to look at the vignette or have a look at main.R

To build and install the package
R CMD build relectro
R CMD INSTALL relectro

##### naming convention to be used in the package #####

Variable names

    Use camelCaps: initial lowercase, then alternate case between words.

Function names

    Use camelCaps: initial lower case, then alternate case between words.
    Do not use ‘.’ (in the S3 class system, some(x) where x is class A will dispatch to some.A).
    Prefix non-exported functions with a ‘.’.

Class names

    Use CamelCaps: initial upper case, then alternate case between words.

File names

    Filename extension for R code should be ‘.R’. Use the prefix ‘methods-‘ for S4 class methods, e.g., ‘methods-coverage.R’. Generic definitions can be listed in a single file, ‘AllGenerics.R’, and class definitions in ‘AllClasses.R’.
    Filename extension for man pages should be ‘.Rd’.



ElectroProject holding Mice and RecSession infomration?
To do the looping, we could have an object called Project, containing an array of RecSession, 
ElectroProject could be saved in a file and loaded, so that we don't need to search the directories everytime
 - buildProject (use list_sessions to find clustered sessions, get all RecSession objects)
 - saveProject to file
 - loadProject from file



Think about plotting common objects: maps, maps autocorrelations, etc.

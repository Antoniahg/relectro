This is a R package to analysis electrophysiological data with R.

If you are starting you might want to look at the vignette or have a look at main.R

To build and install the package
R CMD build relectro
R CMD INSTALL relectro


R object [xdim*y +x]
C 2d array [ydim*x +y]

KNOWN BUGS: 
1) grid score is not working
2) maps are not read the same way in R object and C 2d maps, did some transposition.



How do we represent a cell with its properties in relectro?


Think about plotting common objects: maps, maps autocorrelations, st-auto, st-cross, etc.
If they were a Class, we could have a plot function for them.

What about a default plot function for RecSession, ElectroProject, Positrack, SpikeTrain, SpatialProperties2d?


1 day:
SpikeTrain: -instantaneous firing rate.

Add documentation for all classes, methods and functions

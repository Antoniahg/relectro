This is a R package to analysis electrophysiological data with R.

The speed of the code is very good. Compare to the current way of doing things, it will eliminate having to read the files many times in a row. Should speed up things and make it simpler to do analysis.


List of things to implement before it is usable:

1/2 day: Monday
intervalRes()<- done
crosscorrelation() done
crosscorrelation_events() <- done

1/2 day: Monday
session  R class <- done
	 - desen <- done
	 - intervals <- done
	 - time per trials <-done
   - return intervals for a given environment <-done


1 day: Tuesday
positrack class 
	  - x,y,hd,speed,px_per_cm <- done
    - filter for speed in R <- done
	  - set outside intervals to -1, keep -1 for now. <- done
	  - intervals at a given speed  <- done
	  - speed at given res values <- done


2 days: Wednesday - Tuesday
SpatialProperties2d: 
  Stay close to what firing_map_2d does to start with.
  Store maps in 3 d arrays (1/4 the size of data frames)
        -occupancy<- done
	      -maps (3d array)<-done
	      -info score and sparsity <- done
	      -autocorrelation (3d arrays) <- done
	      -grid score, orientation, spacing <- done
	      -border score <- done

Need to take a break to try to reject a rejection at Neuron. See you later.

datFile: 1 day: Wednesday
  -datFile strucutre
  -read one channel
  -detect up
  -detect down
  -detect ttl pulses
  


ElectroProject holding Mice and RecSession infomration?
To do the looping, we could have an object called Project, containing an array of RecSession, 
ElectroProject could be saved in a file and loaded, so that we don't need to search the directories everytime
 - buildProject (find clustered sessions, get all RecSession objects)
 - saveProject to file
 - loadProject from file


2 days:
Write a vignette to explain the package so far.


2 days:
firing_map_1d: -occupancy
	       -maps
	       -map stats


1 day:
SpikeTrain: -instantaneous firing rate.

This is a R package to analysis electrophysiological data with R.

If you want to start with example, go to main.R

List of things to implement before it is usable:

1/2 day: Monday
intervalRes()<- done
crosscorrelation() done
crosscorrelation_events() <- done

1/2 day: Monday
session  R class <- done
	 - desen <- done
	 - intervals <- done
	 - time per trials <-done
   - return intervals for a given environment <-done

1 day: Tuesday
positrack class 
	  - x,y,hd,speed,px_per_cm <- done
    - filter for speed in R <- done
	  - set outside intervals to -1, keep -1 for now. <- done
	  - intervals at a given speed  <- done
	  - speed at given res values <- done


2 days: Wednesday - Tuesday
SpatialProperties2d: 
  Stay close to what firing_map_2d does to start with.
  Store maps in 3 d arrays (1/4 the size of data frames)
        -occupancy<- done
	      -maps (3d array)<-done
	      -info score and sparsity <- done
	      -autocorrelation (3d arrays) <- done
	      -grid score, orientation, spacing <- done
	      -border score <- done


datFile: 1 day: Wednesday
  -datFile strucutre <- done
  -read one channel <- done

functions: to detect up in dat files
  -detect up <- done
  -detect down <- done


DEVELOPMENT SO FAR STOP HERE

ElectroProject holding Mice and RecSession infomration?
To do the looping, we could have an object called Project, containing an array of RecSession, 
ElectroProject could be saved in a file and loaded, so that we don't need to search the directories everytime
 - buildProject (use list_sessions to find clustered sessions, get all RecSession objects)
 - saveProject to file
 - loadProject from file


2 days:
Write a vignette to explain the package so far.


2 days:
firing_map_1d: -occupancy
	       -maps
	       -map stats


1 day:
SpikeTrain: -instantaneous firing rate.

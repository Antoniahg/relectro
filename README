This is a R package to analysis electrophysiological data with R.

The speed of the code is very good. Compare to the current way of doing things, it will eliminate having to read the files many times in a row. Should speed up things and make it simpler to do analysis.

I don't think it will be very long to build a decent R interface with the c code.



List of things to implement before it is usable:

1/2 day: Monday
intervalRes()<- done
crosscorrelation() done
crosscorrelation_events() <- done

1/2 day: Monday
session  R class <- done
	 - desen <- done
	 - intervals <- done
	 - time per trials <-done
   - return intervals for a given environment <-done


1 day: Tuesday
positrack class 
	  - x,y,hd,speed,px_per_cm <- done
    - filter for speed in R <- done
	  - set outside intervals to -1, keep -1 for now. <- done
	  - intervals at a given speed  <- done
	  - speed at given res values, Perhaps in R


3 days: Wednesday
firing_map_2d: -occupancy
	       -maps
	       -map stats
	       -autocorrelation
	       -grid score
	       -border score
2 days:
firing_map_1d: -occupancy
	       -maps
	       -map stats

1 day:
SpikeTrain: -instantaneous firing rate.

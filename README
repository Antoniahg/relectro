This is a R package to analysis electrophysiological data with R.

The speed of the code is very good. Compare to the current way of doing things, it will eliminate having to read the files many times in a row. Should speed up things adn make it simpler to do analysis.

I don't think it will be very long to build a decent R interface with the c code. On second day, it took me an hour to get the firing rate function to work.


List of functions to implement in c:

1 day:
get_interval_res_index() <- 2 hours
crosscorrelation() <- 2 hours
crosscorrelation_events() <- 2 hours


1 day:
positrack class (all in cm) -> implement all of this as a S4 R class
	  - x,y,hd,speed,px_per_cm
          - intervals at a given speed
	  - filter for speed
	  - set outside intervals to -1
	  - speed at given res values (for speed scores)

1 day:
session  R class
	 - desen
	 - intervals
	 - time per trials
	 - 

3 days:
firing_map_2d: -occupancy
	       -maps
	       -map stats
	       -autocorrelation
	       -grid score
	       -border score

2 days:
firing_map_1d: -occupancy
	       -maps
	       -map stats


1 day:
SpikeTrain: -instantaneous firing rate.

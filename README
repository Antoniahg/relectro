ElectroProject holding Mice and RecSession infomration?
To do the looping, we could have an object called Project, containing an array of RecSession, 
ElectroProject could be saved in a file and loaded, so that we don't need to search the directories everytime
 - buildProject (use list_sessions to find clustered sessions, get all RecSession objects)
 - saveProject to file
 - loadProject from file


Object loading files should have a path option so that we don't need to setwd for each call




Think about plotting common objects: maps, maps autocorrelations, etc.
